# Ex3

this Project implects the interfaces graph_interface,algo_graph. the classes the implements this interfaces are  DiGraph and GraphAlgo using also the class Node and Edge

the NodeData contains:

a dictinery of all the Node thats neigbhors to the node 2)info 3)tag 4)key- each Nodes have indvidual key number last neigbhor key- the key of the last Neigbor when we search the shortest path 6)counters for the methods 7)hashMap of the value of the weight edge(it save only in the min key nodeInfo) the WGraphDs contains: 1)hashMap of all the nodes in the graph 2)counters for the methods

the GraphAlgo contains: 1)a graph 2)array list 3)counters for the method

on the project u can save the graph to json file and also load the json file to a graph algo,  u can find the shortest path between 2 nodes in the graph 
and u can find the scc of specific node using "connected_compunnet" method and u also find all the scc in all the graph using "connected_compunnet" method

in the wiki u find table comparing between payton graph and java graph
